            A Birthday Note to My Dearest Bestie
            Our friendship began the day our places changed, and I started talking to you. I’ll always be grateful to that teacher who made me sit beside you, as that’s when I found a friend for life. Since then, I’ve never regretted becoming your friend.The memories of us—me, you, and Srilakha—studying, laughing, and growing together are priceless. I’ll never forget February 6, when we laughed endlessly during our biology discussion. Our school journey was full of unforgettable moments, and our bond has only grown stronger.
            Even after months or years, nothing changes—the jokes, the laughs, and the connection remain the same. What started in tenth grade has become a lifelong friendship. Because of you, I gained two amazing friends, and our bond is unbreakable.   We may not talk daily, but we know we’ll always be there for each other. One day, I hope we’ll meet as old friends, reminisce about our memories, and introduce our kids, saying, “She’s my best friend.” I’ll stay by your side forever. and saying, *“She’s my best friend.”* You mean so much to me, and I’ll always be by your side—forever.
